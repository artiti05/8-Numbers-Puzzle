# 8-Puzzle Game

A Python-based interactive 8-puzzle game with AI solver capabilities, built using Pygame.

## Overview
The 8-puzzle game is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 3x3 grid with numbered tiles (1â€“8) and one empty space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles to match the goal state by sliding tiles into the empty space.

This program provides both a manual mode where users can solve the puzzle themselves and an AI mode where the puzzle is solved using the A* algorithm.

## Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Use arrow keys to move tiles manually.
- **Shuffle Functionality**: Press `S` to randomize the puzzle.
- **AI Solver**: Press `Space` to solve the puzzle using A* search with a Manhattan distance heuristic.
- **Timer**: Displays the time taken for the AI to solve the puzzle.
- **Animations**: Smooth tile transitions for a visually appealing experience.
- **Time Limit**: AI solver stops if it exceeds the maximum allowed time (60 seconds).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move tiles manually.
- **S**: Shuffle the puzzle.
- **Spacebar**: Solve the puzzle using AI.

## How It Works
1. **Grid Creation**: The grid is initialized as a 3x3 matrix with a random arrangement of tiles.
2. **Tile Movement**: The empty space can be moved up, down, left, or right, swapping positions with adjacent tiles.
3. **AI Solver**: The A* algorithm finds the shortest path to the goal state:
   - **Heuristic**: Manhattan distance is used to estimate the cost of reaching the goal.
   - **Priority Queue**: States are explored based on their combined cost (steps taken + heuristic value).
4. **Animations**: Smooth visual transitions enhance user experience.
